Description: GeneSet displays gene sets in different S3 and S4 class types. For
    the S3 class, there is 'class'-like representation and a tibble-like
    representation. For the S4 class, there is a data.frame-like representation,
    a list-like representation, and an extended S3 tibble-like representation.
